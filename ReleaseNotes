             clMAGMA Release Notes
	
-----------------------------------------------------

clMAGMA is an OpenCL port of MAGMA, intended for a single GPU. 
It supports AMD GPUs. 

Included are routines for the following algorithms:

    * LU, QR, and Cholesky factorizations in both real and complex
      arithmetic (single and double);
    * Hessenberg, bidiagonal, and tridiagonal reductions in both real
      and complex arithmetic (single and double);
    * Linear solvers based on LU, QR, and Cholesky in both real and
      complex arithmetic (single and double);

 0.3.0 - 06-29-2012
    * Reduction to upper Hessenberg form by similarity orthogonal 
      transformations (routines magma_{z|c|d|s}gehrd )
    * Reduction to upper/lower bidiagonal form by similarity orthogonal 
      transformations (routines magma_{z|c|d|s}gebrd )
    * Reduction to tridiagonal form by similarity orthogonal transformations
      ( routines magma_{zhe|che|dsy|ssy}trd )

 0.2.0 - 05-26-2012
    * Change GPU_TARGET in make.inc to descriptive name (e.g., AMD).
    * Added solvers for general and symmetric matrices 
    * Added least squares solver
    * Added multiple precision support for LU factorization
    * All routines provided in this release support s/d/c/z 
      precision arithmetic

 0.1.0 - 04-04-2012
    * LU, QR, and Cholesky dense matrix factorizations
    * Auxiliary OpenCL kernels
